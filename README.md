Application
Future of Sahayak:
 !) Secretary 
Rather than masking itself, it can be used as third entity which talks on your behalf . So no cheating ;P
 @) Small talk 
 We can enable only small talk feature so that whenever any important message comes up, it will not talk on your behalf.
 #) Start convo and get response in a news feed
It can randomly ping your relatives with the "kaise ho" and record their responses and render then in a news feed.
 $) Remote Access
You can remotely turn your bot on or off..
Prototype does :
It can be used in both modes, manual and automatic, i.e you can use the command line interface just as your messenger or leave it running and Sahayak will talk for you.
